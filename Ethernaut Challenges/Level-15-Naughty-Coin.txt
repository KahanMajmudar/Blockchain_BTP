ERC20 implements 2 functions

function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)

So putting a timelock on transfer doesnot stop the owner to use transferFrom. So to send,
1. Check balance using await contract.balanceOf(player)
2. use approve function to tell the contract to approve the send on your behalf.
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) where _value = your balance
3. exceute transferFrom and specify the _to address
